      <h2> Air Jordan, Released 1985 </h2>                                   <!--Første kapittel-->

      <div class="row">                                                      <!--Rad med flexbox-->

          <p>The great-great-grandfather is the Air Jordan 1. The OG. Just like Jordan in his first season in the NBA, this sneaker set the world alight. And still does to this day.
          <br><br>
          MJ himself wore Converse throughout his college career and was more drawn to adidas before signing with Nike. It took incredible design by Peter Moore on this shoe to convince him to join their ranks.
          <br><br>
          It would be the only Air Jordan design to feature the Nike Swoosh, alongside the original "Wings" motif used in early forms of AJ. Even though Jordan was wary of what he called a "devil's" colourway, he wore a boxfresh pair for every game.
          <br><br>
          Oh, also he racked up a measly $5k in fines each time, due to breaking NBA uniform rules. Luckily, you can wear them whenever you want.

      <h2> Air Jordan III, Released 1988 </h2>                              <!--Nytt kapittel-->

      <div class="row">

          <p>The third iteration of the AJ brought a new design mind into the fray, the aptly-named Tinker Shoefield. Not Shoefield, we meant Hatfield. He was a tinkerer though as will be seen over future years.
          <br><br>
          As he was aiming to leave Nike, the Air Jordan 3 reportedly changed Jordan's mind. Could this have been the reason the new "Jumpman" logo was added? He was a big star with a big ego to please, after all.
          <br><br>
          The iconic Nike Air bubble was made visible for the first time, something that would become a notable fixture in Nike's future designs. Elephant skin styling was added to the upper, adding luxury to this silhouette.
          <br><br>
          Comedian Spike Lee starred in the latest advertising campaign with MJ, bringing culture and sneakers closer together. Something which would weave itself into the DNA of the Jordan brand for years to comee.

      <h2> Air Jordan IV, Released 1989 </h2>                             <!--Nytt kapittel-->

        <div class="column">
            
          <p>Coming in a choice of 4 original colourways, this model was the first to be released to the global market. The beginning of a ginormous, well-oiled, money-spinning machine for Nike and Jordan.
          <br><br>
          Another sneaker in the collection that profited from product placement, the Air Jordan 4 appeared in the popular Spike Lee movie "Do The Right Thing" and cemented the brand in popular culture.
          <br><br>
          Eagle-eyed viewers of "The Last Dance" documentary will have noticed His Airness sporting these sneakers whilst sinking his game-winning shot vs. Utah Jazz in game 5 of the 1989 playoffs too. They weren't just made to look good, it turns out.</p>

      <h2> Air Jordan V, Released 1990 </h2>                              <!--Nytt kapittel-->

      <div class="row"> 
        <div class="column">
            
          <p>By this point, MJ was well and truly established in his no.23 vest for the Bulls. It was time for Nike to add his iconic number to the shoe.
          <br><br>
          With a reflective tongue, translucent sole and lace locks, the Air Jordan 5 was a bold look to add to the collection. But, we knew Tinker Hatfield was capable of changing it up. He even added breathable mesh side panels to the upper. The crazy cat.
          <br><br>
          A retro "Bel Air" version was rereleased in 2013, in homage to Will Smith's commitment to donning the sneakers throughout his hit show during the '90s, "The Fresh Prince of Bel Air".</p>
